Algorand Foundation governs the development of the blockchain. 
Updates to the core blockchain protocol are done in a few steps: 
\begin{enumerate}

\item Algorand Foundation announces and posts a specification of the protocol in a public git repository. The URL of the repository commit is used as a ``protocol version'' identifier. This URL must contain a hash that corresponds to the git commit.

\item Any update to the protocol must be supported by the community \emph{on chain} via voting by the block proposers. A block proposer ``supports'' a proposal by including it as the next protocol version. An update is accepted if for an interval of $10000$ rounds, at least $8000$ of the finalized blocks support the same next protocol version.

\item After the end of the $10000$-round voting interval, users are given another $10000$ rounds to update their software. The new specification then takes effect and, from that point on, blocks are produced based on the updated protocol rules.

\end{enumerate}
