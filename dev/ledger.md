  Algorand replicates a state and the state's history between protocol
  participants.  This state and its history is called the _Algorand Ledger_.
---

Overview
========

Parameters
----------

The Algorand Ledger is parameterized by the following values:

 - $t_{\delta}$, the maximum difference between successive timestamps.
 - $T_{\max}$, the length of the _transaction tail_.
 - $B_{\max}$, the maximum number of transaction bytes in a block.
 - $b_{\min}$, the minimum balance for any address.
 - $f_{\min}$, the minimum processing fee for any transaction.
 - $V_{\max}$, the maximum length of protocol version strings.
 - $N_{\max}$, the maximum length of a transaction note string.
 - $G_{\max}$, the maximum number of transactions allowed in a transaction group.
 - $\tau$, the number of votes needed to execute a protocol upgrade.
 - $\delta_d$, the number of rounds over with an upgrade proposal is open.
 - $\delta_x$, the number of rounds needed to prepare for an upgrade.
 - $\omega_r$, the rate at which the reward rate is refreshed.
 - $A$, the size of an earning unit.

States
------

A _ledger_ is a sequence of states which comprise the common information
established by some instantiation of the Algorand protocol.  A ledger is
identified by a string called the _genesis identifier_. Each state consists of
the following components:

 - The _round_ of the state, which indexes into the ledger's sequence of
   states.

 - The _genesis identifier_, which identifies the ledger to which the state
   belongs.

 - The current _protocol version_ and the _upgrade state_.

 - A _timestamp_, which is informational and identifies when the state was first
   proposed.

 - A _seed_, which is a source of randomness used to [establish consensus on the
   next state][abft-spec].

 - The current _reward state_, which describes the policy at which incentives
   are distributed to participants.

 - The current _account state_, which holds account balances and keys for all
   stakeholding addresses.
   - One component of this state is the _transaction tail_, which caches the
	 _transaction sets_ (see below) in the last $T_{\max}$ blocks.


Blocks
------

A _block_ is a data structure which specifies the transition between states.
Each block consists of the following components, which correspond to components
of the state:

 - The block's _round_, which matches the round of the state it is transitioning
   into.  (The block with round 0 is special in that this block specifies not a
   transition but rather the entire initial state, which is called the _genesis
   state_.  This block is correspondingly called the _genesis block_.)

 - The block's _genesis identifier_, which matches the genesis identifier of the
   states it transitions between.

 - The block's _upgrade vote_, which results in the new upgrade state.  The
   block also duplicates the upgrade state of the state it transitions into.

 - The block's _timestamp_, which matches the timestamp of the state it
   transitions into.

 - The block's _seed_, which matches the seed of the state it transitions into.

 - The block's _reward updates_, which results in the new reward state.  The
   block also duplicates the reward state of the state it transitions into.

 - The block's _transaction set_, which represents a set of updates (i.e.,
   _transactions_) to the account state.  The block also duplicates a
   cryptographic commitment to its transaction set.

 - The block's _previous hash_, which is the cryptographic hash of the previous
   block in the sequence.  (The previous hash of the genesis block is 0.)

The data in a block is divided between the _block header_ and its _block body_.
The block body is the block's transaction set, while the block header contains
all other data, including a cryptographic commitment to the transaction set.

A block is _valid_ if each component is also _valid_.  (The genesis block is
always valid).  _Applying_ a valid block to a state produces a new state by
updating each of its components.  The rest of this document defines block
validity and state transitions by describing them for each component.


Round
=====

The round or _round number_ is a 64-bit unsigned integer which indexes into the
sequence of states and blocks.  The round $r$ of each block is one greater than
the round of the previous block.  Given a ledger, the round of a block
exclusively identifies it.

The rest of this document describes components of states and blocks with respect
to some implicit ledger.  Thus, the round exclusively describes some component,
and we denote the round of a component with a subscript.  For instance, the
timestamp of state/block $r$ is denoted $t_r$.


Genesis Identifier
==================

\newcommand \GenesisID {\mathrm{GenesisID}}

The genesis identifier is a short string that identifies an instance of a
ledger.

The genesis identifier of a valid block is the identifier of the block in the
previous round.  In other words, $\GenesisID_{r+1} = \GenesisID_{r}$.


Genesis Hash
============

\newcommand \GenesisHash {\mathrm{GenesisHash}}

The genesis hash is a cryptographic hash of the genesis configuration,
used to unambiguously identify an instance of the ledger.

The genesis hash is set in the genesis block (or the block at which
an upgrade to a protocol supporting GenesisHash occurs), and must be
preserved identically in all subsequent blocks.


Protocol Upgrade State
======================

A protocol version $v$ is a string no more than $V_{\max}$ bytes long. It
corresponds to parameters used to execute some version of the Algorand
protocol.

The upgrade vote in each block consists of a protocol version $v_r$ and a
single bit $b$ indicating whether the block proposer supports the given version.

The upgrade state in each block/state consists of the current protocol version
$v^*_r$, the next proposed protocol version $v'_r$, a 64-bit round number
$s_r$ counting the number of votes for the next protocol version, a 64-bit
round number $d_r$ specifying the deadline for voting on the next protocol
version, and a 64-bit round number $x_r$ specifying when the next proposed
protocol version would take effect, if passed.

An upgrade vote $(v_r, b)$ is valid given the upgrade state
$(v^*_r, v'_r, s_r, d_r, x_r)$ if $v_r$ is the empty string or $v'_r$ is the
empty string, and either

 - $b = 0$ or
 - $b = 1$ with $r < d_r$ and either
    - $v'_r$ is not the empty string or
    - $v_r$ is not the empty string.

If the vote is valid, then the new upgrade state is
$(v^*_{r+1}, v'_{r+1}, s_{r+1}, d_{r+1}, x_{r+1})$ where

 - $v^*_{r+1}$ is $v'_r$ if $r = x_r$ and $v^*_r$ otherwise.
 - $v'_{r+1}$ is
    - the empty string if $r = x_r$ or both $r = s_r$ and $s_r + b < \tau$,
    - $v_r$ if $v'_r$ is the empty string, and
    - $v'_r$ otherwise.
 - $s_{r+1}$ is
    - 0 if $r = x_r$ or both $r = s_r$ and $s_r + b < \tau$, and
    - $s_r + b$ otherwise
 - $d_{r+1}$ is
    - 0 if $r = x_r$ or both $r = s_r$ and $s_r + b < \tau$,
    - $r + \delta_d$ if $v'_r$ is the empty string and $v_r$ is not the empty
      string, and
    - $d_r$ otherwise.
 - $x_{r+1}$ is
    - 0 if $r = x_r$ or both $r = s_r$ and $s_r + b < \tau$,
    - $r + \delta_d + \delta_x$ if $v'_r$ is the empty string and $v_r$ is not
      the empty string, and
    - $x_r$ otherwise.


Timestamp
=========

The timestamp is a 64-bit signed integer.  The timestamp is purely informational
and states when a block was first proposed, expressed in the number of seconds
since 00:00:00 Thursday, 1 January 1970 (UTC).

The timestamp $t_{r+1}$ of a block in round $r$ is valid if:

 - $t_{r} = 0$ or
 - $t_{r+1} > t_{r}$ and $t_{r+1} < t_{r} + t_{\delta}$.


Cryptographic Seed
==================

\newcommand \Seed {\mathrm{Seed}}

The seed is a 256-bit integer.  Seeds are validated and updated according to the
[specification of the Algorand Byzantine Fault Tolerance protocol][abft-spec].
The $\Seed$ procedure specified there returns the seed from the desired round.


Reward State
============

\newcommand \Stake {\mathrm{Stake}}
\newcommand \Units {\mathrm{RewardUnits}}

\newcommand \floor [1]{\left \lfloor #1 \right \rfloor }

The reward state consists of three 64-bit unsigned integers: the total amount
of money distributed to each earning unit since the genesis state $T_r$, the
amount of money to be distributed to each earning unit at the next round $R_r$,
and the amount of money left over after distribution $B^*_r$.

The reward state depends on the $I_{pool}$, the address of the _incentive pool_, and
the functions $\Stake(r, I_{pool})$ and $\Units(r)$.  These are defined as part of the
[Account State][Account State] below.

Informally, every $\omega_r$ rounds, the rate $R_r$ is updated such that rewards given over the next
$\omega_r$ rounds will drain the incentive pool, leaving it with the minimum balance $b_{min}$.
The _rewards residue_ $B^*_r$ is the amount of leftover rewards that should have been given in the previous round but
could not be evenly divided among all reward units. The residue carries over into the rewards to be given in the next round.
The actual draining of the incentive pool account is described in the [Validity and State Changes][Validity and State Changes] section further below.

More formally, let $Z = \Units(r)$. Given a reward state $(T_r, R_r, B^*_r)$, the new reward
state is $(T_{r+1}, R_{r+1}, B^*_{r+1})$ where

 - $R_{r+1} = \floor{\frac{\Stake(r, I_{pool}) - B^*_r - b_{min}}{\omega_r}}$ if
   $R_r \equiv 0 \bmod \omega_r$; $R_{r+1} = R_r$ otherwise,
 - $T_{r+1} = T_r + \floor{\frac{R_r}{Z}}$ if $Z \neq 0$; $T_{r+1} = T_r$
   otherwise, and
 - $B^*_{r+1} = (B^*_r + R_r) \bmod Z$ if $Z \neq 0$; $B^*_{r+1} = B^*_r$
   otherwise.

A valid block's reward state matches the expected reward state.


Account State
=============

\newcommand \Record {\mathrm{Record}}
\newcommand \pk {\mathrm{pk}}

The _balances_ are a set of mappings from _addresses_, 256-bit integers, to
_balance records_.  A _balance record_ contains the following fields: the
account _raw balance_, the account _status_, the account _rewards base_ and
_total awarded amount_, and the account [_participation keys_][partkey-spec].

The account raw balance $a_I$ is a 64-bit unsigned integer which determines how
much money the address has.

The account rewards base $a'_I$ and total awarded amount $a^*_I$ are 64-bit
unsigned integers.

Combined with the account balance, the reward base and total awarded amount are
used to distribute rewards to accounts lazily.  The _account stake_ is a
function which maps a given account and round to the account's balance in that
round and is defined as follows:
$$\Stake(r, I) = a_I + (T_r - a'_I) \floor{\frac{a_I}{A}}$$
unless $p_i = 2$ (see below), in which case:
$$\Stake(r, I) = a_I.$$

$\Units(r)$ is a function that computes the total number of whole _earning
units_ present in a system at round $r$.  A user owns $\floor{\frac{a_I}{A}}$
whole earning units, so the total number of earning units in the system is
$\Units(r) = \sum_I \floor{\frac{a_I}{A}}$ for the $a_I$ corresponding to round
$r$.

TODO define how $\Units$ updates.

The account status $p_I$ is an 8-bit unsigned integer which is either 0, 1,
or 2.  An account status of 0 corresponds to an _offline_ account, a status of 1
corresponds to an _online_ account, and a status of 2 corresponds to a
_non-participating_ account.

Combined with the account stake, the account status determines how much _voting
stake_ an account has, which is a 64-bit unsigned integer defined as follows:

 - The account balance, if the account is online.
 - 0 otherwise.

The account's participation keys $\pk$ are defined in Algorand's [specification
of participation keys][partkey-spec].

An account's participation keys and voting stake from a recent round is returned
by the $\Record$ procedure in the [Byzantine Agreement Protocol][abft-spec].

There exist two special addresses: $I_{pool}$, the address of the _incentive pool_,
and $I_f$, the address of the _fee sink_.  For both of these accounts,
$p_I = 2$.


Transactions
------------

\newcommand \Tx {\mathrm{Tx}}
\newcommand \TxSeq {\mathrm{TxSeq}}
\newcommand \TxTail {\mathrm{TxTail}}
\newcommand \TxType {\mathrm{TxType}}
\newcommand \TxCommit {\mathrm{TxCommit}}

\newcommand \vpk {\mathrm{vpk}}
\newcommand \spk {\mathrm{spk}}
\newcommand \vf {\mathrm{vf}}
\newcommand \vl {\mathrm{vl}}
\newcommand \vkd {\mathrm{vkd}}

\newcommand \Hash {\mathrm{Hash}}
\newcommand \nonpart {\mathrm{nonpart}}

\newcommand \aref {\hat{a}}
\newcommand \aidref {\hat{\mathrm{AssetID}}}

Just as a block represents a transition between two ledger states, a
_transaction_ $\Tx$ represents a transition between two account states. A
transaction contains the following fields:

 - The _transaction type_ $\TxType$, which is a short string that indicates the
   type of a transaction.  The transaction type is either "pay", "keyreg", or
   "audit".  A transaction type of "pay" corresponds to a _payment_ transaction,
   a transaction type of "keyreg" corresponds to a _key registration_
   transaction, and a transaction type of "audit" corresponds to an _audit_
   transaction.

 - The _sender_ $I$, which is an address which identifies the account that
   authorized the transaction.

 - The _fee_ $f$, which is a 64-bit integer that specifies the processing fee
   the sender pays to execute the transaction.

 - The first round $r_1$ and last round $r_2$ for which the transaction may be
   executed.

 - The _genesis identifier_ $\GenesisID$ of the ledger for which this
   transaction is valid.  The $\GenesisID$ is optional.

 - The _genesis hash_ $\GenesisHash$ of the ledger for which this
   transaction is valid.  The $\GenesisHash$ is required.

 - The _group_ $grp$, an optional 32-byte hash whose meaning is described in
   the [Transaction Groups][Transaction Groups] section below.

 - The _note_ $N$, a sequence of bytes with length at most $N_{\max}$ which
   contains arbitrary data.


A payment transaction additionally has the following fields:

 - The _amount_ $a$, which is a 64-bit number that indicates the amount of money
   to be transferred.

 - The _receiver_ $I'$, which is an optional address which specifies the
   receiver of the funds in the transaction.

 - The _closing address_ $I_0$, which is an optional address that collects all
   remaining funds in the account after the transfer to the receiver.

A key registration transaction additionally has the following fields:

 - The _vote public key_ $\vpk$, (root) public authentication key 
   of an account's participation keys ($\pk$).

 - The _selection public key_ $\spk$, public authorization key of 
   an account's participation keys ($\pk$). If either $\vpk$ or 
   $\spk$ is unset, the transaction deregisters the account's participation 
   key set, as the result, marks the account offline.

 - The _vote first_ $\vf$, first valid round (inclusive) of 
   an account's participation key sets.

 - The _vote last_ $\vl$, last valid round (inclusive) of an account's
   participation key sets.

 - The _vote key dilution_ $\vkd$, number of rounds that a single 
  leaf level authentication key can be used. The higher the number, the 
  more ``dilution'' added to the authentication key's security.  

 - An optional (boolean) flag $\nonpart$ which, when deregistering keys,
   specifies whether to mark the account offline (if $\nonpart$ is false)
   or nonparticipatory (if $\nonpart$ is true).

An audit transaction additionally has the following fields:

 - The _comparator_ $P$, which is a string that specifies the type of comparison
   to be done.  It is one of the following values: "=", "<", or ">".

 - The _reference value_ $\aref$ which is a 64-bit constant which the comparison
   is done against.

 - The _reference asset ID_ $\aidref$, which is an optional 40-bit value (TODO
   wait for asset PR to specify data format).  If given, this value specifies
   the ID of the asset to be used for comparison.

The cryptographic hash of the fields above is called the _transaction
identifier_.  This is written as $\Hash(\Tx)$.

A valid transaction can either be a _signed_ transaction or a _multi-signed_
transaction.  This is determined by the _signature_ of a transaction:

 - A valid signed transaction's signature is a 64-byte sequence which validates
   under the sender of the transaction.

 - A valid multisignature transaction's signature is the _msig_ object containing
   the following fields (see [Multisignature][Multisignature] for details):

   - The _subsig_ array of subsignatures each consisting of a signer address and a signature
     as a 64-byte sequence. Note, multisignature transaction must contain
     all signer's addresses in the _subsig_ array even if the transaction has not
     been signed yet.

   - The threshold _thr_ that is a minimum number of signatures required.

   - The multisignature version _v_ (current value is 1).


ApplyData
---------

\newcommand \ClosingAmount {\mathrm{ClosingAmount}}

Each transaction is associated with some information about how it is
applied to the account state.  This information is called ApplyData,
and contains the following fields:

- The closing amount, $\ClosingAmount$, which specifies how many microalgos
  were transferred to the closing address.

- The amount of rewards distributed to each of the accounts touched by this
  transaction.  There are three fields ("rs", "rr", and "rc" keys in msgpack
  encoding), representing the amount of rewards distributed to the sender,
  receiver, and closing addresses respectively.  The fields have integer
  values representing microalgos.  If any of the accounts are the same
  (e.g., the sender and recipient are the same), then that account received
  the sum of the respective reward distributions (i.e., "rs" plus "rr");
  in the reference implementation, one of these two fields will be zero
  in that case.


Transaction Sequences, Sets, and Tails
--------------------------------------

Each block contains a _transaction sequence_, an ordered sequence of
transactions in that block.  The transaction sequence of block $r$ is denoted
$\TxSeq_r$.  Each valid block contains a _transaction commitment_ $\TxCommit_r$
which is the commitment to this sequence (a hash of the msgpack encoding of the
sequence).

There are two differences between how a standalone transaction is encoded,
and how it appears in the block:

- Transactions in a block are encoded in a slightly different way than
  standalone transactions, for efficiency:

  If a transaction contains a $\GenesisID$ value, then (1) it must
  match the block's $\GenesisID$, (2) the transaction's $\GenesisID$
  value must be omitted from the transaction's msgpack encoding in the
  block, and (3) the transaction's msgpack encoding in the block must
  indicate the $\GenesisID$ value was omitted by including a key "hgi"
  with the boolean value true.

  Since transactions must include a $\GenesisHash$ value, the
  $\GenesisHash$ value of each transaction in a block must match the
  block's $\GenesisHash$, and the $\GenesisHash$ value is omitted from
  the transaction as encoded in a block.

- Transactions in a block are also augmented with the ApplyData that reflect
  how that transaction applied to the account state.

The transaction commitment for a block covers the transaction encodings
with the changes described above.  Individual transaction signatures
cover the original encoding of transactions as standalone.

A valid transaction sequence contains no duplicates: each transaction in the
transaction sequence appears exactly once.  We can call the set of these
transactions the _transaction set_.  (For convenience, we may also write
$\TxSeq_r$ to refer unambiguously to this set.)  For a block to be valid, its
transaction sequence must be valid (i.e., no duplicate transactions may appear
there).

All transactions have a _size_ in bytes.  The size of the transaction $\Tx$ is
denoted $|\Tx|$.  For a block to be valid, the sum of the sizes of each
transaction in a transaction sequence must be at most $B_{\max}$; in other words,
$$\sum_{\Tx \in \TxSeq_r} |\Tx| \leq B_{\max}.$$

The transaction tail for a given round $r$ is a set produced from the union of
the transaction identifiers of each transaction in the last $T_{\max}$
transaction sets and is used to detect duplicate transactions.  In other words,
$$\TxTail_r = \bigcup_{r-T_{\max} \leq s \leq r-1}
              \{\Hash(\Tx) | \Tx \in \TxSeq_s\}.$$
As a result, the transaction tail for round $r+1$ is computed as follows:
$$\TxTail_{r+1} = \TxTail_r \setminus
                  \{\Hash(\Tx) | \Tx \in \TxSeq_{r-T_{\max}}\} \cup
				  \{\Hash(\Tx) | \Tx \in \TxSeq_r\}.$$
The transaction tail is part of the ledger state but is distinct from the
account state and is not committed to in the block.


Transaction Groups
------------------

A transaction may include a "Group" field (msgpack tag "grp"), a 32-byte hash
that specifies what _transaction group_ the transaction belongs to.
Informally, a transaction group is an ordered list of transactions that, in
order to be confirmed at all, must all be confirmed together, in order, in the
same block. The "Group" field in each transaction is set to what is essentially
the hash of the list of transaction hashes in the group, except to avoid
circularity, when hashing a transaction it is hashed with its "Group" field
omitted. In this way a user wanting to require transaction A to confirm if and
only if transactions B and C confirm can take the hashes of transactions A, B,
and C (without the "Group" field set), hash them together, and set the "Group"
field of all three transactions to that hash before signing them.
A group may contain no more than $G_{max}$ transactions.

More formally, when evaluating a block, consider the $i$th and $(i+1)$th
transaction in the payset to belong to the same _transaction group_ if the
"Group" fields of the two transactions are equal and nonzero.  The block may
now be viewed as an ordered sequence of transaction groups, where each
transaction group is a contiguous sublist of the payset consisting of one or
more transactions with equal "Group" field.  For each transaction group where
the transactions have nonzero "Group", compute the _TxGroup hash_ as follows:

 - Take the hash of each transaction in the group but with its "Group" field omitted.
 - Hash this ordered list of hashes -- more precisely, hash the canonical msgpack encoding of a struct with a field "txlist" containing the list of hashes, using "TG" as domain separation prefix.

If the TxGroup hash of any transaction group in a block does not match the "Group" field of the transactions in that group (and that "Group" field is nonzero), then the block is invalid. Additionally, if a block contains a transaction group of more than $G_{max}$ transactions, the block is invalid.

Beyond this check, each transaction in a group is evaluated separately and must be valid on its own, as described below in the [Validity and State Changes][Validity and State Changes] section. For example, a group containing a zero-fee transaction and a very-high-fee transaction would be rejected because the first transaction has fee less than $f_{\min}$, even if the average transaction fee of the group were above $f_{\min}$. As another example, an account with balance 50 could not spend 100 in transaction A and afterward receive 500 in transaction B, even if transactions A and B are in the same group, because transaction A would leave the account with a negative balance.

Validity and State Changes
--------------------------

The new account state which results from applying a block is the account state
which results from applying each transaction in that block, in sequence. For a
block to be valid, each transaction in its transaction sequence must be valid at
the block's round $r$ and for the block's genesis identifier $\GenesisID_B$.

For a transaction
$$\Tx = (\GenesisID, \TxType, r_1, r_2, I, I', I_0, f, a, N, \pk, \nonpart, P, \aref, \aidref)$$
to be valid at the intermediate state $\rho$ in round $r$ for the genesis
identifier $\GenesisID_B$, the following conditions must all hold:

 - It must represent a transition between two valid account states.
 - Either $\GenesisID = \GenesisID_B$ or $\GenesisID$ is the empty string.
 - $\TxType$ is either "pay", "keyreg", or "audit".
 - There are no extra fields that do not correspond to $\TxType$.
 - $0 \leq r_2 - r_1 \leq T_{\max}$.
 - $r_1 \leq r \leq r_2$.
 - $|N| \leq N_{\max}$.
 - $I \neq I_{pool}$ and $I \neq 0$.
 - $\Stake(r+1, I) \geq f \geq f_{\min}$.
 - Exactly one of the signature or the multisignature is present and verifies
   for $\Hash(\Tx)$ under $I$.
 - $\Hash(\Tx) \notin \TxTail_r$.
 - If $\TxType$ is "pay",
    - $I \neq I_k$ or both $I' \neq I_{pool}$ and $I_0 \neq 0$.
    - $\Stake(r+1, I) - f > a$ if $I' \neq I$ and $I' \neq 0$.
    - If $I_0 \neq 0$, then $I_0 \neq I$.
 - If $\TxType$ is "keyreg",
    - $p_{\rho, I} \ne 2$ (i.e., nonparticipatory accounts may not issue keyreg transactions)
    - If $\nonpart$ is true then $\pk = 0$.
 - If $\TxType$ is "audit", (TODO wait for asset PR to specify for $\aidref$)
    - If $P$ is "<", $\Stake(\rho, I) - f < \aref$;
	- if $P$ is ">", $\Stake(\rho, I) - f > \aref$; and
	- otherwise (i.e., $P$ is "="), $\Stake(\rho, I) - f = \aref$.

Given that a transaction is valid, it produces the following updated account
state for intermediate state $\rho+1$:

 - For $I$:
    - If $I_0 \neq 0$ then
      $a_{\rho+1, I} = a'_{\rho+1, I} = a^*_{\rho+1, I} = p_{\rho+1, I} = \pk_{\rho+1, I} = 0$;
    - otherwise,
        - $a_{\rho+1, I} = \Stake(\rho+1, I) - a - f$ if $I' \neq I$ and
		  $a_{\rho+1, I} = \Stake(\rho+1, I) - f$ otherwise.
        - $a'_{\rho+1, I} = T_{r+1}$.
        - $a^*_{\rho+1, I} = a^*_{\rho, I} +
                             (T_{r+1} - a'_{\rho, I}) \floor{\frac{a_{\rho, I}}{A}}$.
        - If $\TxType$ is "pay", then $\pk_{\rho+1, I} = \pk_{\rho, I}$ and $p_{\rho+1, I} = p_{\rho, I}$;
        - otherwise, if $\TxType$ is "keyreg",
            - $\pk_{\rho+1, I} = \pk$
            - $p_{\rho+1, I} = 0$ if $\pk = 0$ and $\nonpart = \text{false}$
            - $p_{\rho+1, I} = 2$ if $\pk = 0$ and $\nonpart = \text{true}$
            - $p_{\rho+1, I} = 1$ if $\pk \ne 0$.

 - For $I'$ if $I \neq I'$ and either $I' \neq 0$ or $a \neq 0$:
    - $a_{\rho+1, I'} = \Stake(\rho+1, I') + a$.
    - $a'_{\rho+1, I'} = T_{r+1}$.
    - $a^*_{\rho+1, I'} = a^*_{\rho, I'} +
                         (T_{r+1} - a'_{\rho, I'}) \floor{\frac{a_{\rho, I'}}{A}}$.
 - For $I_0$ if $I_0 \neq 0$:
    - $a_{\rho+1, I_0} = \Stake(\rho+1, I_0) + \Stake(\rho+1, I) - a - f$.
    - $a'_{\rho+1, I_0} = T_{r+1}$.
    - $a^*_{\rho+1, I_0} = a^*_{\rho, I_0} +
                         (T_{r+1} - a'_{\rho, I_0}) \floor{\frac{a_{\rho, I_0}}{A}}$.
 - For all other $I^* \neq I$, the account state is identical to that in view $\rho$.

TODO define the sequence of intermediate states

The final intermediate account $\rho_k$ state changes the balance of the
incentive pool as follows:
$$a_{\rho_k, I_{pool}} = a_{\rho_{k-1}, I_{pool}} - R_r(\Units(r))$$

An account state in the intermediate state $\rho+1$ and at round $r$ is valid if
all following conditions hold:

 - For all addresses $I \notin \{I_{pool}, I_f\}$, either $\Stake(\rho+1, I) = 0$ or
   $\Stake(\rho+1, I) \geq b_{\min}$.

 - $\sum_I \Stake(\rho+1, I) = \sum_I \Stake(\rho, I)$.


Previous Hash
=============

\newcommand \Prev {\mathrm{Prev}}

The previous hash is a cryptographic hash of the previous block header in the
sequence of blocks.  The sequence of previous hashes in each block header forms
an authenticated, linked-list of the reversed sequence.

Let $B_{r}$ represent the block header in round $r$, and let $H$ be some
cryptographic function.  Then the previous hash $\Prev_{r+1}$ in the block for
round $r+1$ is $\Prev_{r+1} = H(B_{r})$.


Multisignature
==============

Multisignature term describes a special multisignature address, signing and
validation procedures. In contrast with a regular account address
that may be understood as a public key, multisignature address is a hash of
a constant string identifier for multisignature, version, threshold, and
all addresses used for multisignature address creation:
$$MSig = \Hash("MultisigAddr", version, threshold, \pk_1, ..., \pk_s)$$
One address might be specified multiple times in multisignature address creation.
In this case every occurrence is counted independently in validation.

Validation process checks all non-empty signatures are valid and their count
not less than the threshold. Validation fails if any of signatures is invalid
even if count of all remaining correct signatures is greater or equals than the threshold.
