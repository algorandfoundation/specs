|:-------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `box_create`  | create a box named A, of length B. Fail if the name A is empty or B exceeds 32,768. Returns 0 if A already existed, else 1                                                                        |
| `box_extract` | read C bytes from box A, starting at offset B. Fail if A does not exist, or the byte range is outside A's size.                                                                                   |
| `box_replace` | write byte-array C into box A, starting at offset B. Fail if A does not exist, or the byte range is outside A's size.                                                                             |
| `box_splice`  | set box A to contain its previous bytes up to index B, followed by D, followed by the original bytes of A that began at index B+C.                                                                |
|   `box_del`   | delete box named A if it exists. Return 1 if A existed, 0 otherwise                                                                                                                               |
|   `box_len`   | X is the length of box A if A exists, else 0. Y is 1 if A exists, else 0.                                                                                                                         |
|   `box_get`   | X is the contents of box A if A exists, else ''. Y is 1 if A exists, else 0.                                                                                                                      |
|   `box_put`   | replaces the contents of box A with byte-array B. Fails if A exists and len(B) != len(box A). Creates A if it does not exist                                                                      |
| `box_resize`  | change the size of box named A to be of length B, adding zero bytes to end or removing bytes from the end, as needed. Fail if the name A is empty, A is not an existing box, or B exceeds 32,768. |
