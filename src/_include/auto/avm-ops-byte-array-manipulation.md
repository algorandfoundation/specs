|     `getbit`      | Bth bit of (byte-array or integer) A. If B is greater than or equal to the bit length of the value (8*byte length), the program fails                                                     |
|     `setbit`      | Copy of (byte-array or integer) A, with the Bth bit set to (0 or 1) C. If B is greater than or equal to the bit length of the value (8*byte length), the program fails                    |
|     `getbyte`     | Bth byte of A, as an integer. If B is greater than or equal to the array length, the program fails                                                                                        |
|     `setbyte`     | Copy of A with the Bth byte set to small integer (between 0..255) C. If B is greater than or equal to the array length, the program fails                                                 |
|     `concat`      | Join A and B                                                                                                                                                                              |
|       `len`       | Yields length of byte value A                                                                                                                                                             |
|  `substring s e`  | A range of bytes from A starting at S up to but not including E. If E < S, or either is larger than the array length, the program fails                                                   |
|   `substring3`    | A range of bytes from A starting at B up to but not including C. If C < B, or either is larger than the array length, the program fails                                                   |
|   `extract s l`   | A range of bytes from A starting at S up to but not including S+L. If L is 0, then extract to the end of the string. If S or S+L is larger than the array length, the program fails       |
|    `extract3`     | A range of bytes from A starting at B up to but not including B+C. If B+C is larger than the array length, the program fails `extract3` can be called using `extract` with no immediates. |
| `extract_uint16`  | A uint16 formed from a range of big-endian bytes from A starting at B up to but not including B+2. If B+2 is larger than the array length, the program fails                              |
| `extract_uint32`  | A uint32 formed from a range of big-endian bytes from A starting at B up to but not including B+4. If B+4 is larger than the array length, the program fails                              |
| `extract_uint64`  | A uint64 formed from a range of big-endian bytes from A starting at B up to but not including B+8. If B+8 is larger than the array length, the program fails                              |
|   `replace2 s`    | Copy of A with the bytes starting at S replaced by the bytes of B. Fails if S+len(B) exceeds len(A) `replace2` can be called using `replace` with 1 immediate.                            |
|    `replace3`     | Copy of A with the bytes starting at B replaced by the bytes of C. Fails if B+len(C) exceeds len(A) `replace3` can be called using `replace` with no immediates.                          |
| `base64_decode e` | decode A which was base64-encoded using _encoding_ E. Fail if A is not base64 encoded with encoding E                                                                                     |
|   `json_ref r`    | key B's value, of type R, from a valid UTF-8 encoded json object A                                                                                                                        |
