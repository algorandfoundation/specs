|       `balance`       | balance for account A, in microalgos. The balance is observed after the effects of previous transactions in the group, and after the fee for the current transaction is deducted. Changes caused by inner transactions are observable immediately following `itxn_submit`                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|     `min_balance`     | minimum required balance for account A, in microalgos. Required balance is affected by ASA, App, and Box usage. When creating or opting into an app, the minimum balance grows before the app code runs, therefore the increase is visible there. When deleting or closing out, the minimum balance decreases after the app executes. Changes caused by inner transactions or box usage are observable immediately following the opcode effecting the change. |
|  `acct_params_get f`  | X is field F from account A. Y is 1 if A owns positive algos, else 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `voter_params_get f`  | X is field F from online account A as of the balance round: 320 rounds before the current round. Y is 1 if A had positive algos online in the agreement round, else Y is 0 and X is a type specific zero-value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
