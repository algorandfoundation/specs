# Agreement Protocol Overview

The following section is a _non-normative_ overview of the Algorand Agreement Protocol.

We attempt to ease understanding of the _normative section_ and provide readers
with a comprehensive view of its inner workings, while maintaining technical correctness.

We provide pseudocode examples and diagrams for readers and potential implementers
to clarify how these processes may be implemented, and how they might interact with
one another.

For a normative specification of the Algorand Byzantine Fault Tolerance protocol,
refer to the normative [ABFT section](./abft.md).
