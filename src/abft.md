title: "Algorand Byzantine Fault Tolerance Protocol Specification"
date: \today
abstract: >
  The _Algorand Byzantine Fault Tolerance protocol_ is an interactive protocol which produces a sequence of common information between a set of participants.
---



Conventions and Notation 
========================

This specification defines a _player_ to be a unique participant in
this protocol.

This specification describes the operation of a single _correct_
player.  A correct player follows this protocol exactly and is
distinct from a _faulty_ player.  A faulty player may deviate from
the protocol in any way, so this specification does not describe the
behavior of those players.

Correct players do not follow distinct protocols, so this
specification describes correct behavior with respect to a single,
implicit player.  When the protocol must describe a player distinct
from the implicit player (for example, a message which originated from
another player), the protocol will use subscripts to distinguish
different players.  Subscripts are omitted when the player is
unambiguous.  For instance, a player might be associated with some
``address'' $I$; if this player is the $k$th player in the protocol,
then this address may also be denoted $I_k$.

This specification will describe certain objects as _opaque_.  This
document does not specify the exact implementation of opaque objects,
but it does specify the subset of properties required of any
implementation of some opaque object.

Opaque data definitions and semantics may be specified in other
documents, which this document will cite when available.

All integers described in this document are unsigned.


Parameters
==========

\newcommand \FilterTimeout {\mathrm{FilterTimeout}}

\newcommand \DeadlineTimeout {\mathrm{DeadlineTimeout}}

The protocol is parameterized by the following constants:

 - $\lambda, \lambda_{0min}, \lambda_{0max}, \lambda_f, \Lambda, \Lambda_0$ are values representing durations of time.
 - $\delta_s, \delta_r$ are positive integers (the "seed lookback" and
   "seed refresh interval").

For convenience, we define $\delta_b$ (the "balance lookback") to be
$2\delta_s\delta_r$.

We define $\FilterTimeout(p)$ on period $p$ as follows:

  - If $p = 0$:
    The $\FilterTimeout(p)$ is calculated dynamically based on the lower 95th percentile of observed 
    lowest credential per round arrival times. 

    - 2$\lambda_{0min} <= \FilterTimeout(p) <= 2\lambda_{0max}$
  - If $p \ne 0$:
    - $\FilterTimeout(p) = 2\lambda$

We define $\DeadlineTimeout(p)$ on period $p$ as follows:

  - If $p = 0$:
    - $\DeadlineTimeout(p) = \Lambda_0$
  - If $p \ne 0$:
    - $\DeadlineTimeout(p) = \Lambda$


Algorand sets $\delta_s = 2$, $\delta_r = 80$, $\lambda = 2$ seconds, $\lambda_{0min} = 0.25$ seconds, 
$\lambda_{0max} = 1.5$ seconds, $\lambda_f = 5$ minutes, $\Lambda = 17$ seconds, and $\Lambda_0 = 4$ seconds.

Identity, Authorization, and Authentication
===========================================

\newcommand \pk {\mathrm{pk}}
\newcommand \sk {\mathrm{sk}}
\newcommand \fv {\text{first}}
\newcommand \lv {\text{last}}
\newcommand \Sign {\mathrm{Sign}}
\newcommand \Verify {\mathrm{Verify}}
\newcommand \Rand {\mathrm{Rand}}

\newcommand \Bbar {\bar{B}}
\newcommand \taubar {\bar{\tau}}

A player is uniquely identified by a 256-bit string $I$ called an
_address_.

Each player owns exactly one _participation keypair_. A participation
keypair consists of a _public key_ $\pk$ and a _secret key_ $\sk$.
A keypair is an opaque object which is defined in the [specification
of participation keys in Algorand][partkey-spec]. Each participation
keypair is valid for a range of rounds $(r_\fv, r_\lv)$.

Let $m, m'$ be arbitrary sequences of bits, $B_k, \Bbar$ be 64-bit integers
representing balances in microalgos with rewards applied,
$\tau, \taubar$ be 32-bit integers, and $Q$ be a 256-bit string.  Let
$(\pk_k, \sk_k)$ be some valid keypair.

A secret key supports a _signing_ procedure
$$
y := \Sign(m, m', \sk_k, B_k, \Bbar, Q, \tau, \taubar)
$$
where $y$ is opaque and are cryptographically resistant to tampering,
where defined.  Signing is not defined on many inputs: for any given
input, signing may fail to produce an output.

The following functions are defined on $y$:

 - _Verifying_:
   $\Verify(y, m, m', \pk_k, B_k, \Bbar, Q, \tau, \taubar) = w$, where
   $w$ is a 64-bit integer called the _weight_ of $y$. $w \neq 0$ if
   and only if $y$ was produced by signing by $\sk_k$ (up to
   cryptographic security).  $w$ is uniquely determined given fixed
   values of $m', \pk_k, B_k, \Bbar, Q, \tau, \taubar$.

 - _Comparing_: Fixing the inputs $m', \Bbar, Q, \tau, \taubar$ to a
   signing operation, there exists a total ordering on the outputs
   $y$. In other words, if
   $f(\sk, B) = \Sign(m, m', \sk, B, \Bbar, Q, \tau, \taubar) = y$,
   and $S = \{(\sk_0, B_0), (\sk_1, B_1), \ldots, (\sk_n, B_n)\}$, then
   $\{f(x) | x \in S\}$ is a totally ordered set.  We write that
   $y_1 < y_2$ if $y_1$ comes before $y_2$ in this ordering.

 - _Generating Randomness_: Let $y$ be a valid output of a signing
   operation with $\sk_k$. Then $r = \Rand(y, \pk_k)$ is defined to be
   a pseudorandom 256-bit integer (up to cryptographic security).  $r$
   is uniquely determined given fixed values of
   $m', \pk_k, B_k, \Bbar, Q, \tau, \taubar$.

The signing procedure is allowed to produce a nondeterministic output,
but the functions above must be well-defined with respect to a given
input to the signing procedure (e.g., a procedure that implements
$\Verify(\Sign(\ldots))$ always returns the same value).


The Ledger of Entries
=====================

\newcommand \Digest {\mathrm{Digest}}
\newcommand \Encoding {\mathrm{Encoding}}

\newcommand \Seed {\mathrm{Seed}}
\newcommand \Record {\mathrm{Record}}
\newcommand \DigestLookup {\mathrm{DigestLookup}}
\newcommand \Stake {\mathrm{Stake}}

\newcommand \ValidEntry {\mathrm{ValidEntry}}
\newcommand \Entry {\mathrm{Entry}}

An _entry_ is a pair $e = (o, Q)$ where $o$ is some opaque object, and
$Q$ is a 256-bit integer called a _seed_.

The following functions are defined on $e$:

 - _Encoding_: $\Encoding(e) = x$ where $x$ is a variable-length
   bitstring.

 - _Summarizing_: $\Digest(e) = h$ where $h$ is a 256-bit integer.
   ($h$ should be a cryptographic commitment to the contents of $e$.)

A _ledger_ is a sequence of entries $L = (e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n)$.  A
_round_ $r$ is some 64-bit index into this sequence.

The following functions are defined on $L$:

 - _Validating_: $\ValidEntry(L, o) = 1$ if and only if $o$ is _valid
   with respect to $L$_.  This validity property is opaque.

 - _Seed Lookup_: If $e_r = (o_r, Q_r)$, then $\Seed(L, r)$ = $Q_r$.

 - _Record Lookup_: $\Record(L, r, I_k) = (\pk_{k,r}, B_{k,r}, r_\fv, r_\lv)$ for
   some address $I_k$, some public key $\pk_{k,r}$, and some 64-bit
   integer $B_{k,r}$. $r_\fv$ and $r_\lv$ define the first valid and last
   valid rounds for this participating account.

 - _Digest Lookup_: $\DigestLookup(L, r) = \Digest(e_r)$.

 - _Total Stake Lookup_: We use $\mathcal{K}_{r_b,r_v}$ to represent all players with participation keys
   at $r_b$ that are eligible to vote at $r_v$. 
   Let $\mathcal{K}_{r_b,r_v}$ be the set of all $k$ for which $(\pk_{k,r_b}, B_{k,r_b}, r_\fv, r_\lv) = \Record(L, r_b, I_k)$ and $r_\fv \leq r_v \leq r_\lv$ holds. 
   Then $\Stake(L, r_b, r_v) = \sum_{k \in \mathcal{K}_{r_b,r_v}} B_{k,r_b}$.

A ledger may support an opaque _entry generation_ procedure
$$
o := \Entry(L, Q)
$$
which produces an object $o$ for which $\ValidEntry(L, o) = 1$.


Messages
========

Players communicate with each other by exchanging _messages_.


Elementary Data Types
---------------------

\newcommand \Propose {\mathit{propose}}
\newcommand \Soft {\mathit{soft}}
\newcommand \Cert {\mathit{cert}}
\newcommand \Late {\mathit{late}}
\newcommand \Redo {\mathit{redo}}
\newcommand \Down {\mathit{down}}
\newcommand \Next {\mathit{next}}

\newcommand \CommitteeSize {\mathrm{CommitteeSize}}
\newcommand \CommitteeThreshold {\mathrm{CommitteeThreshold}}

\newcommand \Proposal {\mathrm{Proposal}}
\newcommand \Hash {\mathrm{Hash}}

A _period_ $p$ is a 64-bit integer.

A _step_ $s$ is an 8-bit integer.  Certain steps are named for clarity.
These steps are defined as follows:

 - $\Propose = 0$
 - $\Soft = 1$
 - $\Cert = 2$
 - $\Late = 253$
 - $\Redo = 254$
 - $\Down = 255$
 - $\Next_s = s+3$

The following functions are defined on $s$:

 - _Committee Size_: $\CommitteeSize(s)$ is a 64-bit integer
    defined as follows:
$$
\CommitteeSize(s) = \left\{
\begin{array}{rl}
     20 & : s = \Propose \\
   2990 & : s = \Soft \\
   1500 & : s = \Cert \\
    500 & : s = \Late \\
   2400 & : s = \Redo \\
   6000 & : s = \Down \\
   5000 & : \text{otherwise}
\end{array}
\right.
$$
 - _Committee Threshold_: $\CommitteeThreshold(s)$ is a 64-bit integer
    defined as follows:
$$
\CommitteeThreshold(s) = \left\{
\begin{array}{rl}
     0 & : s = \Propose \\
  2267 & : s = \Soft \\
  1112 & : s = \Cert \\
   320 & : s = \Late \\
  1768 & : s = \Redo \\
  4560 & : s = \Down \\
  3838 & : \text{otherwise}
\end{array}
\right.
$$

A _proposal-value_ is a tuple
$v = (I, p, \Digest(e), \Hash(\Encoding(e)))$ where $I$ is an
address (the "original proposer"), $p$ is a period (the "original period"),
and $\Hash$ is some cryptographic hash function.  The special proposal where all
fields are the zero-string is called the bottom proposal $\bot$.


Votes
-----

\newcommand \Vote {\mathrm{Vote}}
\newcommand \Equivocation {\mathrm{Equivocation}}

Let $I$ be an address, $r$ be a round, $p$ be a period, $s$ be a step,
and $v$ be a proposal-value, let $x$ be a canonical encoding of the
5-tuple $(I, r, p, s, v)$, and let $x'$ be a canonical encoding of the
4-tuple $(I, r, p, s)$.  Let $y$ be an arbitrary bitstring.
Then we say that the tuple
$$
(I, r, p, s, v, y)
$$
is a _vote from $I$ for $v$ at round $r$, period $p$,
step $s$_ (or _a vote from $I$ for $v$ at $(r, p, s)$_),
denoted $\Vote(I, r, p, s, v)$.

Moreover, let $L$ be a ledger where $|L| \geq \delta_b$.
Let $(\sk, \pk)$ be a keypair, $B, \Bbar$ be 64-bit integers, $Q$ be a
256-bit integer, and $\tau, \taubar$ 32-bit integers.  We say that
this vote is _valid with respect to $L$_ (or simply _valid_ if $L$ is
unambiguous) if the following conditions are true:

 - $r \leq |L| + 2$

 - Let $v = (I_{orig}, p_{orig}, d, h)$. If $s = 0$, then $p_{orig} \le p$.
   Furthermore, if $s = 0$ and $p = p_{orig}$, then $I = I_{orig}$.

 - If $s \in \{\Propose, \Soft, \Cert, \Late, \Redo\}$, $v \neq \bot$.
   Conversely, if $s = \Down$, $v = \bot$.

 - Let $(\pk, B, r_\fv, r_\lv) = \Record(L, r - \delta_b, I)$,
   $\Bbar = \Stake(L, r - \delta_b, r)$, $Q = \Seed(L, r - \delta_s)$,
   $\tau = \CommitteeThreshold(s)$, and
   $\taubar = \CommitteeSize(s)$.
   Then $\Verify(y, x, x', \pk, B, \Bbar, Q, \tau, \taubar) \neq 0$ and
   $r_\fv \leq r \leq r_\lv$.

Observe that valid votes contain outputs of the $\Sign$ procedure;
i.e., $y := \Sign(x, x', \sk, B, \Bbar, Q, \tau, \taubar)$.

Informally, these conditions check the following:

 - The vote is not too far in the future for $L$ to be able to validate.

 - "Propose"-step votes can either propose a new proposal-value for this period
   ($p_{orig} = p$) or claim to "re-propose" a value originally proposed in an
   earlier period ($p_{orig} < p$). But they can't claim to "re-propose" a value
   from a future period. And if the proposal-value is new ($p_{orig} = p$) then
   the "original proposer" must be the voter.

 - The $\Propose$, $\Soft$, $\Cert$, $\Late$, and $\Redo$ steps must vote for an
   actual proposal.  The $\Down$ step must only vote for $\bot$.

 - The last condition checks that the vote was properly signed by a voter who
   was selected to serve on the committee for this round, period, and step,
   where the committee selection process uses the voter's stake and keys as of
   $\delta_b$ rounds before the vote. It also checks if the vote's round is
   within the range associated with the voter's participation key.

An _equivocation vote pair_ or _equivocation vote_
$\Equivocation(I, r, p, s)$ is a pair of votes which differ in
their proposal values. In other words,
$$
\begin{aligned}
\Equivocation(I, r, p, s)
 = (&\Vote(I, r, p, s, v_1), \\
    &\Vote(I, r, p, s, v_2))
\end{aligned}
$$
for some $v_1 \neq v_2$.

An equivocation vote pair is _valid with respect to $L$_ (or simply
_valid_ if $L$ is unambiguous) if both of its constituent votes are
also valid with respect to $L$.


Bundles
-------

\newcommand \Bundle {\mathrm{Bundle}}

Let $V$ be any set of votes and equivocation votes. We say that $V$
_is a bundle for $v$ in round $r$, period $p$, and step $s$_
(or a _bundle for $v$ at $(r, p, s)$_), denoted
$\Bundle(r, p, s, v)$.

Moreover, let $L$ be a ledger where $|L| \geq \delta_b$. We
say that this bundle is _valid with respect to $L$_ (or simply _valid_
if $L$ is unambiguous) if the following conditions are true:

 - Every element $a_i \in V$ is valid with respect to $L$.

 - For any two elements $a_i, a_j \in V$, $I_i \neq I_j$.

 - For any element $a_i \in V$, $r_i = r, p_i = p, s_i = s$.

 - For any element $a_i \in V$, either $a_i$ is a vote and
   $v_i = v$, or $a_i$ is an equivocation vote.

 - Let $w_i$ be the weight of the signature in $a_i$. Then
   $\sum_i w_i \geq \CommitteeThreshold(s)$.


Proposals
---------

\newcommand \Payload {\mathrm{Payload}}

Let $e = (o, s)$ be an entry and $y$ be the output of a $\Sign$
procedure.  The pair $(e, y)$ is a _proposal_ or a _proposal payload_.

Moreover, let $L$ be a ledger where $|L| \geq \delta_b$,
and let $v = (I, p, h, x)$ be some proposal-value. We say that
this proposal is _a valid proposal matching $v$ with respect
To $L$_ (or simply that this proposal _matches $v$_ if $L$ is
unambiguous) if the following conditions are true:

 - $\ValidEntry(L, e) = 1$.

 - $h = \Digest(e)$.
 
 - $x = \Hash(\Encoding(e))$.

 - The seed $s$ and seed proof are valid as specified in the following section.

 - Let $(\pk, B, r_\fv, r_\lv) = \Record(L, r - \delta_b, I)$.
   If $p = 0$, then $\Verify(y, Q_0, Q_0, \pk, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) \neq 0$.

 - Let $(\pk, B, r_\fv, r_\lv) = \Record(L, r - \delta_b, I)$.
   Then $r_\fv \leq r \leq r_\lv$.

If $e$ matches $v$, we write $e = \Proposal(v)$.


Seed
----

Informally, the protocol interleaves $\delta_s$ seeds in an alternating
sequence.  Each seed is derived from a seed $\delta_s$ rounds in the past through
either a hash function or through a VRF, keyed on the entry
proposer. Additionally, every $\delta_s\delta_r$ rounds,  the digest of a previous entry
(specifically, from round $r - \delta_s\delta_r$) is hashed into the result. The seed
proof is the corresponding VRF proof, or 0 if the VRF was not used.

More formally, suppose $I$ is a correct proposer in round $r$ and period $p$.
Let $(\pk, B, r_\fv, r_\lv) = \Record(L, r - \delta_b, I)$ and $\sk$ be the secret key
corresponding to $\pk$.  Let $\alpha$ be a 256-bit integer.  Then $I$ computes
the seed proof $y$ for a new entry as follows:

  - If $p = 0$:
     - $y = \mathrm{VRF.Prove}(\Seed(L, r-\delta_s), \sk)$
     - $\alpha = \Hash(\mathrm{VRF.ProofToHash}(y), I)$
  - If $p \ne 0$:
     - $y = 0$
     - $\alpha = \Hash(\Seed(L, r-\delta_s))$

Now $I$ computes the seed $Q$ as follows:
$$
Q = \left\{
\begin{array}{rl}
  H(\alpha, \DigestLookup(L, r-\delta_s\delta_r)) & : (r \bmod \delta_s\delta_r) < \delta_s \\
  H(\alpha) & : \text{otherwise}
\end{array}
\right.
$$

The seed is valid if the following verification procedure succeeds:

1. Let $(\pk, B, r_\fv, r_\lv) = \Record(L, r - \delta_b, I)$; let $q_0 = \Seed(L, r-\delta_s)$.

2. If $p = 0$, check $\mathrm{VRF.Verify}(y, q_0, \pk)$, immediately returning
   failure if verification fails. Let
   $q_1 = \Hash(\mathrm{VRF.ProofToHash}(y), I)$ and continue to step 4.

3. If $p \ne 0$, let $q_1 = \Hash(q_0)$. Continue.

4. If $r \equiv (r \bmod \delta_s) \mod \delta_r\delta_s$, then check
   $Q = \Hash(q_1, \DigestLookup(L, r-\delta_s\delta_r))$. Otherwise,
   check $Q = q_1$.

Note: Round $r$ leader selection and committee selection both use the seed from
$r - \delta_s$ and the balances / public keys from $r - \delta_b$.

Note: For reproposals, the period $p$ used in this section is the _original_
period, not the reproposal period.


State Machine
=============

\newcommand \Player {\mathrm{Player}}
\newcommand \abold {\mathbf{a}}
\newcommand \vbar {\bar{v}}
\newcommand \Timer {\mathcal{T}}

This specification defines the Algorand agreement protocol as a state
machine.  The input to the state machine is some serialization of
events, which in turn results in some serialization of network
transmissions from the state machine.

We can define the operation of the state machine as transitions
between different states.  A transition $N$ maps some initial state
$S_0$, a ledger $L_0$, and an event $e$ to an output state $S_1$, an
output ledger $L_1$, and a sequence of output network transmissions
$\abold = (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$.
We write this as
$$
N(S_0, L_0, e) = (S_1, L_1, \abold).
$$
If no transmissions are output, we write that $\abold = \epsilon$.


Events
------

The state machine _receives_ two types of events as inputs.

1. _message events_: A message event is received when a vote, a
   proposal, or a bundle is received.  A message event is simply
   written as the message that is received.
2.  _timeout events_: A timeout event is received when a specific
   amount of time passes after the beginning of a period.  A timeout
   event $\lambda$ seconds after period $p$ begins is denoted
   $t(\lambda, p)$.


Outputs
-------

The state machine produces a series of network transmissions as
output.  In each transmission, the player broadcasts a vote, a
proposal, or a bundle to the rest of the network.

A player may perform a special broadcast called a _relay_.  In a
relay, the data received from another peer is broadcast to all peers
except for the sender.

A broadcast action is simply written as the message to be
transmitted.  A relay action is written as the same message except
with an asterisk.  For instance, an action to relay a vote is written
as $\Vote^*(r, p, s, v)$.


Player State Definition
=======================

\newcommand \sbar {\bar{s}}

We define the _player state_ $S$ to be the following tuple:
$$
S = (r, p, s, \sbar, V, P, \vbar)
$$
where

 - $r$ is the current round,
 - $p$ is the current period,
 - $s$ is the current step,
 - $\sbar$ is the _last concluding step_,
 - $V$ is the set of all votes,
 - $P$ is the set of all proposals, and
 - $\vbar$ is the _pinned_ value.
 
We say that a player has _observed_ 

 - $\Proposal(v)$ if $\Proposal(v) \in P$
 - $\Vote_l(r, p, s, v)$ if $\Vote_l(r, p, s, v) \in V$
 - $\Bundle(r, p, s, v)$ if $\Bundle_l(r, p, s, v) \subset V$
 - that round $r$ (period 0) has _begun_ if there exists some $p$ such
   that $\Bundle(r-1, p, \Cert, v)$ was also observed
 - that round $r$, period $p > 0$ has _begun_ if there exists some $p$
   such that either
    - $\Bundle(r, p-1, s, v)$ was also observed for some 
      $s > \Cert, v$, or
    - $\Bundle(r, p, \Soft, v)$ was observed for some $v$.

An event causes a player to observe something if the player has not
observed that thing before receiving the event and has observed that
thing after receiving the event. For instance, a player may observe a
vote $\Vote$, which adds this vote to $V$:
$$
 N((r, p, s, \sbar, V, P, \vbar), L_0, \Vote)
= ((r', p', \ldots, V \cup \{\Vote\}, P, \vbar'), L_1, \ldots).
$$
We abbreviate the transition above as
$$
 N((r, p, s, \sbar, V, P, \vbar), L_0, \Vote)
 = ((S \cup \Vote, P, \vbar), L_1, \ldots).
$$
Note that _observing_ a message is distinct from _receiving_ a
message.  A message which has been received might not be observed (for
instance, the message may be from an old round).  Refer to the [relay
rules][Relay Rules] for details.


Special Values
--------------

We define two functions $\mu(S, r, p), \sigma(S, r, p)$, which are
defined as follows:

$\mu(S, r, p)$ is defined as the proposal-value in the vote in round
$r$ and period $p$ with the minimal credential. More formally, let
$$
V_{r, p} = \{\Vote(I, r, p, 0, v) | \Vote \in V\}
$$
where $V$ is the set of votes in $S$. Then if $\Vote_l(r, p, 0, v_l)$
is the vote with the smallest weight in $V_{r, p}$, then
$\mu(S, r, p) = v_l$.

If $V_{r, p}$ is empty, then $\mu(S, r, p) = \bot$.

$\sigma(S, r, p)$ is defined as the sole proposal-value for which
there exists a soft-bundle in round $r$ and period $p$. More formally,
suppose $\Bundle(r, p, \Soft, v) \subset V$. Then
$\sigma(S, r, p) = v$.

If no such soft-bundle exists, then $\sigma(S, r, p) = \bot$.

If there exists a proposal-value $v$ such that $\Proposal(v) \in V$
and $\sigma(S, r, p) = v$, we say that $v$ is _committable for round
$r$, period $p$_ (or simply that $v$ is _committable_ if $(r, p)$ is
unambiguous).


Relay Rules
===========

Here we describe how players handle message events.

Whenever the player receives a message event, it may decide to _relay_
that or another message. In this case, the player will produce that
output before producing any subsequent output (which may result from
the player's observation of that message; see the [broadcast
rules][Broadcast Rules] below).

A player may receive messages from a peer which indicates that the
peer is misbehaving. These cases are marked with an asterisk (*) and
enable the node to perform a special action (e.g., disconnect from the
peer).

We say that a player _ignores_ a message if it produces no outputs on
receiving that message.


Votes
-----

On receiving a vote $Vote_k(r_k, p_k, s_k, v)$ a player

 - Ignores* it if $\Vote_k$ is invalid.
 - Ignores it if $s = 0$ and $\Vote_k \in V$.
 - Ignores it if $s = 0$ and $\Vote_k$ is an equivocation.
 - Ignores it if $s > 0$ and $\Vote_k$ is a second equivocation.
 - Ignores it if
    - $r_k \notin [r,r+1]$ or
    - $r_k = r + 1$ and either
       - $p_k > 0$ or
       - $s_k \in (\Next_0, \Late)$ or
    - $r_k = r$ and one of
       - $p_k \notin [p-1,p+1]$ or
       - $p_k = p + 1$ and $s_k \in (\Next_0, \Late)$ or
       - $p_k = p$ and $s_k \in (\Next_0, \Late)$ and $s_k \notin [s-1,s+1]$ or
       - $p_k = p - 1$ and $s_k \in (\Next_0, \Late)$ and
	     $s_k \notin [\sbar-1,\sbar+1]$.
 - Otherwise, relays $\Vote_k$, observes it, and then produces any
   consequent output.

Specifically, if a player ignores the vote,
$$
N(S, L, \Vote_k(r_k, p_k, s_k, v)) = (S, L, \epsilon)
$$
while if a player relays the vote,
$$
 N(S, L, \Vote_k(r_k, p_k, s_k, v))
= (S' \cup \Vote(I, r_k, p_k, s_k, v), L',
   (\Vote_k^*(r_k, p_k, s_k, v),\ldots)).
$$


Bundles
-------

On receiving a bundle $\Bundle(r_k, p_k, s_k, v)$ a player

 - Ignores* it if $\Bundle(r, p, s, v)$ is invalid.
 - Ignores it if
    - $r_k \neq r$ or
    - $r_k = r$ and $p_k + 1 < p$.
 - Otherwise, observes the votes in $\Bundle(r_k, p_k, s_k, v)$ in
   sequence. If there exists a vote which causes the player to observe
   some bundle $\Bundle(r_k, p_k, s_k, v')$ for some $s_k$, then the
   player relays $\Bundle(r_k, p_k, s_k, v')$, and then executes any
   consequent action; if there does not, the player ignores it.
   
Specifically, if the player ignores the bundle without observing its
votes,
$$
N(S, L, \Bundle(r_k, p_k, s_k, v)) = (S, L, \epsilon);
$$
while if a player ignores the bundle but observes its votes,
$$
N(S, L, \Bundle(r_k, p_k, s_k, v))
= (S' \cup \Bundle(r_k, p_k, s_k, v), L, \epsilon);
$$
and if a player, on observing the votes in the bundle, observes a
bundle for some value (not necessarily distinct from the bundle's
value),
$$
N(S, L, \Bundle(r_k, p_k, s_k, v))
= (S' \cup \Bundle(r_k, p_k, s_k, v), L',
   (\Bundle^*(r_, p_k, s_k, v'), \ldots)).
$$


Proposals
---------

On receiving a proposal $\Proposal(v)$ a player

 - Relays $\Proposal(v)$ if $\sigma(S, r+1, 0) = v$.
 - Ignores it if it is invalid.
 - Ignores it if $\Proposal(v) \in P$.
 - Relays $\Proposal(v)$, observes it, and then produces any
   consequent output,
   if $v \in \{\sigma(S, r, p), \vbar, \mu(S, r, p)\}$.
 - Otherwise, ignores it.

Specifically, if the player ignores a proposal,
$$
N(S, L, \Proposal(v)) = (S, L, \epsilon)
$$
while if a player relays the proposal _after_ checking if it is valid,
$$
N(S, L, \Proposal(v))
= (S' \cup \Proposal(v), L', (\Proposal^*(v), \ldots)).
$$

However, in the first condition above, the player relays
$\Proposal(v)$ _without_ checking if it is valid.  Since the proposal
has not been seen to be valid, the player cannot observe it yet, so
$$
N(S, L, \Proposal(v)) = (S, L, (\Proposal^*(v))).
$$
Note: An implementation may _buffer_ a proposal in this case.
Specifically, an implementation which relays a proposal without
checking that it is valid may optionally choose to replay this event
when it observes that a new round has begun (see [below][Internal
Transitions]).  In this case, on the conclusion of a new round, this
proposal is processed once again as input.

Implementations may store and relay fewer proposals than specified
here to improve efficiency. However, implementations are always
required to relay proposals which match the following proposal-values
(where $r$ is the current round and $p$ is the current period):

 - $\vbar$
 - $\sigma(S, r, p), \sigma(S, r, p-1)$
 - $\mu(S, r, p)$ if $\sigma(S, r, p)$ is not set and $\mu(S, r, p+1)$
   if $\sigma(S, r, p+1)$ is not set


Internal Transitions
====================

After receiving message events, the player updates some components of
its state.


New Round
---------

When a player observes that a new round $(r, 0)$ has begun, the player
sets $\sbar := s, \vbar := \bot, p := 0, s := 0$. Specifically,
if a new round has begun,
$$
 N((r-i, p, s, \sbar, V, P, \vbar), L, \ldots)
 = ((r, 0, 0, s, V', P', \bot), L', \ldots)
$$
for some $i > 0$.


New Period
----------

When a player observes that a new period $(r, p)$ has begun, the
player sets $\sbar := s, s := 0$. Also, the player sets $\vbar := v$ if
the player has observed $\Bundle(r, p-1, s, v)$ given some values $s > \Cert$
(or $s = \Soft$), $v \neq \bot$; if none exist, the player sets $\vbar :=
\sigma(S, r, p-i)$ if it exists, where $p-i$ was the player's period
immediately before observing the new period; and if none exist, the
player does not update $\vbar$.

In other words, if $\Bundle(r, p-1, s, v) \in V'$ for some
$v \neq \bot, s > \Cert$ or $s = \Soft$,
$$
 N((r, p-i, s, \sbar, V, P, \vbar), L, \ldots)
 = ((r, p, 0, s, V', P, v), L', \ldots);
$$
and otherwise, if $\Bundle(r, p-1, s, \bot) \in V'$ for some $s > \Cert$
with $\sigma(S, r, p-i)$ defined,
$$
 N((r, p-i, s, \sbar, V, P, \vbar), L, \ldots)
 = ((r, p, 0, s, V', P, \sigma(S, r, p-i)), L', \ldots);
$$
and otherwise
$$
 N((r, p-i, s, \sbar, V, P, \vbar), L, \ldots)
 = ((r, p, 0, s, V', P, \vbar), L', \ldots);
$$
for some $i > 0$ (where $S = (r, p-i, s, \sbar, V, P, \vbar))$.


Garbage Collection
------------------

When a player observes that either a new round or a new period
$(r, p)$ has begun, then the player _garbage-collects_ old state. In
other words,
$$
 N((r-i, p-i, s, \sbar, V, P, \vbar), L, \ldots)
 = ((r, p, \sbar, 0, V' \setminus V^*_{r, p}, P' \setminus P^*_{r, p},
    \vbar), L, \ldots).
$$
where
$$
\begin{aligned}
V^*_{r, p}
 &=    \{\Vote(I, r', p', \sbar, v) | \Vote \in V, r' < r\} \\
 &\cup \{\Vote(I, r', p', \sbar, v) | \Vote \in V, r' = r, p' + 1 < p\}
\end{aligned}
$$
and $P^*_{r, p}$ is defined similarly.


New Step
--------

A player may also update its step after receiving a timeout event.

On observing a timeout event of $\FilterTimeout(p)$ for period $p$, the player sets
$s := \Cert$.

On observing a timeout event of $\DeadlineTimeout(p)$ for period $p$, the
player sets $s := \Next_0$.

On observing a timeout event of
$\DeadlineTimeout(p) + 2^{s_t}\lambda + r$ where
$r \in [0, 2^{s_t}\lambda]$ sampled uniformly at random, the player sets
$s := s_t$.

In other words,
$$
\begin{aligned}
  &N((r, p, s, \sbar, V, P, \vbar), L, t(\FilterTimeout(p), p))
 &&= ((r, p, \Cert, \sbar, V, P, \vbar), L', \ldots) \\
  &N((r, p, s, \sbar, V, P, \vbar), L, t(\DeadlineTimeout(p), p))
 &&= ((r, p, \Next_0, \sbar, V, P, \vbar), L', \ldots) \\
  &N((r, p, s, \sbar, V, P, \vbar), L,
     t(\DeadlineTimeout(p) + 2^{s_t}\lambda + r, p))
 &&= ((r, p, s_t, \sbar, V, P, \vbar), L', \ldots).
 \end{aligned}
$$


Broadcast Rules
===============

Upon observing messages or receiving timeout events, the player state
machine emits network outputs, which are externally visible. The
player may also append an entry to the ledger.

A correct player emits only valid votes.  Suppose the player is
identified with the address $I$ and possesses the secret key $\sk$,
and the agreement is occurring on the ledger $L$.  Then the player
constructs a vote $\Vote(I, r, p, s, v)$ by doing the following:

 - Let $(\pk, B, r_\fv, r_\lv) = \Record(L, r - \delta_b, I)$,
   $\Bbar = \Stake(L, r - \delta_b)$, $Q = \Seed(L, r - \delta_s)$,
   $\tau = \CommitteeThreshold(s)$, $\taubar = \CommitteeSize(s).$

 - Encode $x := (I, r, p, s, v), x' := (I, r, p, s).$

 - Try to set $y := \Sign(x, x', \sk, B, \Bbar, Q, \tau, \taubar).$

If the signing procedure succeeds, the player broadcasts
$\Vote(I, r, p, s, v) = (I, r, p, s, v, y)$. Otherwise, the player
does not broadcast anything.

For certain broadcast vote-messages specified here, a node is
forbidden to _equivocate_ (i.e., produce a pair of votes which contain
the same round, period, and step but which vote for different proposal
values). These messages are marked with an asterisk (*) below. To
prevent accidental equivocation after a power failure, nodes should
checkpoint their state to crash-safe storage before sending these
messages.


Resynchronization Attempt
-------------------------

Where specified, a player attempts to resynchronize.  A
resynchronization attempt involves the following:

 - First, the player broadcasts its _freshest bundle_, if one exists.
   A player's freshest bundle is a complete bundle defined as follows:
    - $\Bundle(r, p, \Soft, v) \subset V$ for some $v$, if it exists,
      or else
    - $\Bundle(r, p-1, s, \bot) \subset V$ for some $s > \Cert$, if it
      exists, or else
    - $\Bundle(r, p-1, s, v) \subset V$ for some
      $s > \Cert, v \neq \bot$, if it exists.

 - Second, if the player broadcasted a bundle $\Bundle(r, p, s, v)$,
   and $v \neq \bot$, then the player broadcasts $\Proposal(v)$ if the
   player has it.

Specifically, a resynchronization attempt corresponds to no additional
outputs if no freshest bundle exists
$$
N(S, L, \ldots) = (S', L', \ldots),
$$
corresponds to a broadcast of a bundle after a relay output and before
any subsequent broadcast outputs, if a freshest bundle exists but no
matching proposal exists
$$
N(S, L, \ldots) = (S', L', (\ldots, \Bundle^*(r, p, \Soft, v), \ldots)),
$$
and otherwise corresponds to a broadcast of both a bundle and a
proposal after a relay output and before any subsequent broadcast
outputs
$$
 N(S, L, \ldots) = (S', L',
    (\ldots, \Bundle^*(r, p, \Soft, v), \Proposal(v), \ldots)).
$$


Proposals
---------

On observing that $(r, p)$ has begun, the player attempts to
resynchronize, and then

 - if $p = 0$ or there exists some $s > \Cert$ where
   $\Bundle(r, p-1, s, \bot)$ was observed, then a player generates a
   new proposal $(v', \Proposal(v'))$ and then broadcasts
   $(\Vote(I, r, p, 0, v'), \Proposal(v'))$.

 - if $p > 0$ and there exists some $s_0 > \Cert, v$ where
   $\Bundle(r, p-1, s_0, v)$ was observed, while there exists no
   $s_1 > \Cert$ where $\Bundle(r, p-1, s_1, \bot)$ was observed,
   then the player broadcasts $\Vote(I, r, p, 0, v)$. Moreover, if
   $\Proposal(v) \in P$, the player then broadcasts $\Proposal(v)$.
   
A player generates a new proposal by executing the entry-generation
procedure and by setting the fields of the proposal
accordingly. Specifically, the player creates a proposal payload
$((o, s), y)$ by setting
$o := \Entry(L), Q := \Seed(L, r-1)$,
$y := \Sign(Q, Q, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)$,
and $s := \Rand(y, \pk)$ if $p = 0$ and $s := \Hash(\Seed(L, r-1))$
otherwise.  This consequently defines the matching proposal-value
$v = (I, p, \Digest(e), \Hash(\Encoding(e))).$

In other words, if the player generates a new proposal,
$$
N(S, L, \ldots) = (S', L', (\ldots, \Vote(I, r, p, 0, v'), \Proposal(v'))),
$$
while if the player broadcasts an old proposal,
$$
N(S, L, \ldots) = (S', L', (\ldots, \Vote(I, r, p-1, 0, v), \Proposal(v)))
$$
if $\Proposal(v) \in P$ and
$$
N(S, L, \ldots) = (S', L', (\ldots, \Vote(I, r, p-1, 0, v)))
$$
otherwise.


Reproposal Payloads
-------------------

On observing $\Vote(I, r, p, 0, v)$, if $\Proposal(v) \in P$ then the
player broadcasts $\Proposal(v)$.

In other words, if $\Proposal(v) \in P$,
$$
N(S, L, \Vote(I, r, p, 0, v)) = (S', L', (\Proposal(v))).
$$


Filtering
---------

On observing a timeout event of $\FilterTimeout(p)$ (where
$\mu = (H, H', l, p_\mu) = \mu(S, r, p)$),

 - if $\mu \neq \bot$ and if
    - $p_\mu = p$ or
    - there exists some $s > \Cert$ such that
      $\Bundle(r, p-1, s, \mu)$ was observed.
   then the player broadcasts $\Vote(I, r, p, \Soft, \mu)$.

 - if there exists some $s_0 > \Cert$ such that
   $\Bundle(r, p-1, s_0, \vbar)$ was observed and there exists no
   $s_1 > \Cert$ such that $\Bundle(r, p-1, s_1, \bot)$ was
   observed, then the player broadcasts*
   $\Vote(I, r, p, \Soft, \vbar)$.

 - otherwise, the player does nothing.

In other words, in the first case above,
$$
N(S, L, t(\FilterTimeout(p), p)) = (S, L, \Vote(I, r, p, \Soft, \mu));
$$
while in the second case above,
$$
N(S, L, t(\FilterTimeout(p), p)) = (S, L, \Vote(I, r, p, \Soft, \vbar));
$$
and if neither case is true,
$$
N(S, L, t(\FilterTimeout(p), p)) = (S, L, \epsilon).
$$

Certifying
----------

On observing that some proposal-value $v$ is committable for its
current round $r$, and some period $p' \geq p$ (its current period),
if $s \leq \Cert$, then then the player broadcasts*
$\Vote(I, r, p, \Cert, v)$.  (It can be shown that this occurs either
after a proposal is received or a soft-vote, which can be part of a
bundle, is received.)

In other words, if observing a soft-vote causes a proposal-value to
become committable,
$$
 N(S, L, \Vote(I, r, p, \Soft, v))
 = (S', L, (\ldots, \Vote(I, r, p, \Cert, v)));
$$
while if observing a bundle causes a proposal-value to become
committable,
$$
 N(S, L, \Bundle(r, p, \Soft, v))
 = (S', L, (\ldots, \Vote(I, r, p, \Cert, v)));
$$
and if observing a proposal causes a proposal-value to become
committable,
$$
 N(S, L, \Proposal(v))
 = (S', L, (\ldots, \Vote(I, r, p, \Cert, v)));
$$
as long as $s \leq \Cert$.


Commitment
----------

On observing $\Bundle(r, p, \Cert, v)$ for some value $v$, the player
_commits_ the entry $e$ corresponding to $\Proposal(v)$; i.e., the
player appends $e$ to the sequence of entries on its ledger $L$.
(Evidently, this occurs either after a vote is received or after a
bundle is received.)

In other words, if observing a cert-vote causes the player to commit
$e$,
$$
 N(S, L, \Vote(I, r, p, \Cert, v))
 = (S', L || e, \ldots));
$$
while if observing a bundle causes the player to commit $e$,
$$
 N(S, L, \Bundle(r, p, \Cert, v))
 = (S', L || e, \ldots)).
$$
Note: Occasionally, an implementation may not have $e$ at the point
$e$ becomes committed.  In this case, the implementation may wait
until it receives $e$ somehow (perhaps by requesting peers for $e$).
Alternatively, the implementation may continue running the protocol
until it receives $e$.  However, if the protocol chooses to continue
running, it may not transmit any vote for which $v \neq \bot$ until it
has committed $e$.


Recovery
--------

On observing a timeout event of

 - $T = \DeadlineTimeout(p)$ or
 - $T = \DeadlineTimeout(p) + 2^{s_t}\lambda + r$ where
   $r \in [0, 2^{s_t}\lambda]$ sampled uniformly at random,

the player attempts to resynchronize and then broadcasts*
$\Vote(I, r, p, \Next_s, v)$ where

 - $v = \sigma(S, r, p)$ if $v$ is committable in $(r, p)$,
 - $v = \vbar$ if there does not exist a $s_0 > \Cert$ such that
   $\Bundle(r, p-1, s_0, \bot)$ was observed and there exists an
   $s_1 > \Cert$ such that $\Bundle(r, p-1, s_1, \vbar)$ was
   observed,
 - and $v = \bot$ otherwise.

In other words, if a proposal-value $v$ is committable in the current
period,
$$
N(S, L, t(T, p)) = (S', L, (\ldots, \Vote(I, r, p, \Next_s, v)));
$$
while in the second case,
$$
N(S, L, t(T, p)) = (S', L, (\ldots, \Vote(I, r, p, \Next_s, \vbar)));
$$
and otherwise,
$$
N(S, L, t(T, p)) = (S', L, (\ldots, \Vote(I, r, p, \Next_s, \bot))).
$$


Fast Recovery
-------------

On observing a timeout event of $T = k\lambda_f + r$ where $k$ is a positive
integer and $r \in [0, \lambda_f]$ sampled uniformly at random, the player
attempts to resynchronize.  Then,

 - The player broadcasts* $\Vote(I, r, p, \Late, v)$ if $v = \sigma(S, r, p)$ is
   committable in $(r, p)$.
 - The player broadcasts* $\Vote(I, r, p, \Redo, \vbar)$ if there does not exist
   a $s_0 > \Cert$ such that $\Bundle(r, p-1, s_0, \bot)$ was observed and there
   exists an $s_1 > \Cert$ such that $\Bundle(r, p-1, s_1, \vbar)$ was
   observed.
 - Otherwise, the player broadcasts* $\Vote(I, r, p, \Down, \bot)$.

Finally, the player broadcasts all $\Vote(I, r, p, \Late, v) \in V$, all
$\Vote(I, r, p, \Redo, v) \in V$, and all $\Vote(I, r, p, \Down, \bot) \in V$
that it has observed.
