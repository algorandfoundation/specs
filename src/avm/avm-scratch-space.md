# The Scratch Space (Heap)

In addition to the Stack, the AVM has a _Scratch Space_ (or _heap_) of \\( 256 \\)
positions.

Like Stack values, scratch locations may hold `stackValues` (of either `uint64`
or `bytes` types) and are initialized as zeroed-out `uint64` values.

> The _Scratch Space_ is an additional area of volatile memory used at runtime. Itâ€™s
> useful for storing values needed multiple times during program execution, or that
> stay the same for long periods. It provides a convenient place to keep such persistent
> or reusable data during the program execution.

## Indexing

Scratch Space locations are mapped to \\( 0 \\)-based integer index.

## Access

The Scratch Space is accessed by the `load(s)` and `store(s)` opcodes which move
data respectively:

- From the Scratch Sspace to the Stack;

- From the Stack to the Scratch Space.

## Persistency

Application calls **MAY** inspect the _final_ Scratch Space of earlier application
call transactions in the _same group_ using `gload(s')(s)`, where:

- `s` is the integer index of a Scratch Sspace location,

- `s'` is the integer index of an earlier application call transaction in the group.
