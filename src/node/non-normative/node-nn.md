# Algod Node Overview

This chapter provides a _non-normative_ overview of the `algod` node daemon components.

Most of the constructs covered span across multiple subsystems described in the
rest of the _Algorand Specifications_.

In particular, this chapter focuses on the following `algod` node operations:

- Initialization,

- Configuration,

- Shutdown.

And also provides an overview of `algod` REST APIs.
